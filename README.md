# TiredTechnician

An easier way to add books straight to LazyLibrarian. 

A Library Technician is

> a skilled library and information professional trained to perform the day-to-day functions of a library, and assists librarians in the acquisition, preparation, and organization of information. They also assist library patrons in finding information.

## To install

- Create a folder in the root of your webserver called TiredTechnician.
- Download all the files and unzip them into the folder.
- Edit the settings.php file with your hostname:port and API from LazyLibrarian.
- Browse to http://localhost/TiredTechnician.
- Start searching for books.

## Known Issues

- If your search query is too broad it will time out. Try to use a more narrow search.
